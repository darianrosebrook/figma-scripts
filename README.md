> Speed up your workflow or experiment with the Figma API through scripts. Backed by the same editor infrastructure used by Microsoft VS Code, Scripter provides a fun and safe environment for playing with the Figma plugin API without the need to write actual plugins. Just type and run.

You can follow the instructions there to use these scripts.

Any changes done to your workspace in figma can be recovered with liberal use of âŒ˜ + Z (ctrl + z) or the [Figma Version History](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006754-View-a-file-s-version-history)
